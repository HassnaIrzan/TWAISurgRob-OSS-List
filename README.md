This repository serves as an internal resources for staff working with the [Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Medical Engineering (CME)](https://medicalengineering.org.uk/) - [Pillar 3 on "Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence for Sensory-rich Surgical Robotics"](https://medicalengineering.org.uk/centre-activities/pillar-3-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-for-sensory-rich-surgical-robotics/).

The objective is for Centre members to list relevant open-source software they develop, contribute to, or use heavily. This will hopefully serve as a means of knowledge exchange.
